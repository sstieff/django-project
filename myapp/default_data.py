      description="An antibiotic produced naturally by certain blue molds, and now usually prepared synthetically, that kills bacteria.",
      background="Fleming accidentally stumbled upon the mold Penicillium notatum, which produced a substance that killed bacteria.",
      outcome="This chance discovery revolutionized medicine by providing an effective treatment for bacterial infections and saving countless lives. Without Penicillin, we wouldn't have a punchline to the joke: 'what do you give a man who has everything?'",

      background="In 1903, the Wright brothers flew for 12 seconds over a distance of 120 feet at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. This achievement marked the beginning of modern aviation and transformed transportation and global connectivity",
      outcome="Airplanes allow humans to travel overnight what would have taken months to travel.  They have increased the reach of humanity both for good and bad, as both bombs and aid can be dropped from the same plane. Without airplanes, we would not have the opportunity to be kicked in the back for several hours by a small child.",
